This is going to be use as the core rendering engine for my own android games.

Most of the code comes from my previous Milkshape 3d projects and everything will be ported from C/C++ over to Java for the sake compatibility, performance and stability.

The app will be tested on the Motorola XOOM with android version 4.0.3 instead of using an emulator.
